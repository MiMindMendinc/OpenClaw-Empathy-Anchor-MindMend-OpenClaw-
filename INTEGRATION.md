# Integration Summary

## Overview

This repository successfully integrates the [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) personal AI assistant framework with a custom **Empathy Anchor** skill for youth mental health support.

## What Was Done

### ✅ Core Integration
- **OpenClaw Dependency**: Added as a dependency in `package.json` (version ^2026.1.30)
- **Entry Point**: Created `index.js` that loads OpenClaw and displays setup instructions
- **Configuration**: Added `openclaw.config.json` with empathy-focused settings

### ✅ Empathy Anchor Skill
- **Skill Documentation**: Comprehensive `SKILL.md` with guidelines, examples, and best practices
- **Crisis Detection**: Patterns and responses for various risk levels
- **Resource Database**: National and Michigan-specific crisis resources
- **Safety Protocols**: Clear escalation paths and professional help encouragement

### ✅ Documentation
- **README.md**: Complete project overview with setup instructions
- **SETUP.md**: Step-by-step installation guide
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contribution guidelines with safety requirements
- **docs/USAGE.md**: Detailed usage examples and testing procedures

### ✅ Configuration Files
- **.env.example**: Environment variable templates
- **openclaw.config.json**: Privacy-first configuration
- **.gitignore**: Updated to exclude build artifacts and sensitive files

## Architecture

```
User Application (index.js)
    ↓
OpenClaw Framework (from npm)
    ├── Gateway (communication hub)

**Note**: This integration approach (using OpenClaw as a dependency) is more maintainable than forking the entire repository, as it allows automatic updates to OpenClaw while maintaining our custom skill and configuration.
